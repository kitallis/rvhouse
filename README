To build:

copy build_config.py.dist to build_config.py and edit the file
to have correct paths etc. for your system.

Release build:
just run scons
Debug build:
run scons debug=yes

For building scons is needed:
http://www.scons.org/
Stand-alone Windows build available also:
https://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=2672

For building Qt (Qt 4.7.2 used, later versions may work also):
 - On Linux:
   ./configure.exe -prefix=<path to where to install qt> -static -no-sql-sqlite -no-sql-sqlite2 -no-sql-sqlite_symbian
   make
   
 - On Windows with MinGW:
   export QTDIR=<path to extracted qt directory>/
   export PATH=${PATH}:${QTDIR}
   export QMAKESPEC=$QTDIR/mkspecs/win32-g++
   ./configure.exe -prefix=<path to where to install qt> -static -release
   mingw32-make
   
Under windows, you also need to build resource.o to the
src directory from resource.rc & resource.h. If you are
unsure how to do that, contact me.

When built, you can create an installation executable with
Inno Setup using install/installer.iss script.
